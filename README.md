## 📘 DSA Concepts Used

Even though this is a frontend project, it still includes some core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts:

- **Arrays** – Used for storing and rendering product lists, cart items, and customer feedback.
- **Objects** – Each product and cart item is stored as an object with properties like `id`, `name`, and `price`.
- **Array Methods** – `map`, `filter`, `find` are used to loop through arrays, display products, and manage the cart.
- **Context API** – Acts like a global store (similar to a HashMap) for managing cart state across components.
- **Routing (React Router)** – Works like a tree traversal to navigate between pages like `/` and `/checkout`.
