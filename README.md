## 📐 DSA Concepts Used

This project includes foundational Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) concepts:

- **Arrays & Objects**: Used to manage product lists, cart items, and customer data.
- **Filtering & Mapping**: Dynamically render and update UI based on data (e.g., displaying product components).
- **React Context API**: Works like a global HashMap to share and update state across components.
- **Routing Tree**: React Router mimics tree traversal for rendering different routes/pages.

> While no advanced algorithms are used, the project demonstrates practical use of core DSA in real-world development.
